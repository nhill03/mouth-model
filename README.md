This repository contains prototype drawings, CAD models, a sketch
for controlling a stepper motor, and a video demonstrating the
mouth model. This was designed for Daniel Weinstein to test and
collect data from bioFET sensors mounted on molar bands to passively
record and store oral pH data. The model was designed for research
being conducted at Tufts University as part of Dan's Senior Design
Project and for the student startup UCHU Biosensors, Inc.

The stepper motor is driven by a SparkFun Big Easy Driver board
and an Arduino Uno R3. The board is powered by a 15v wall adapter
and the motor draws about 1.7-2 amp/phase. The motor is a NEMA-17
size bi-polar stepper motor and generates 66.7in*oz of holding 
torque. Future versions of this model may include internal temp.
sensors, a GUI or hardware interface for controlling motor settings,
and a motor-controlled salivation system to control rates more 
objectively. The model will also include a stick on a tongue
to be inserted and swished around the mouth to disperse saliva.
